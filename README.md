Python Data Analysis Project

📌 Project Overview

This project is a data analysis task performed using Python. The dataset provided contains employee information from ABC company with 458 rows and 9 columns. The goal is to analyze and visualize employee data based on multiple criteria.

📂 Dataset Details

The dataset (myexcel.csv) includes the following columns:

Name - Employee name

Team - Team in which the employee works

Number - Employee jersey number (if applicable)

Position - Employee job role

Age - Employee age

Height - Employee height

Weight - Employee weight

College - Institution attended (if available)

Salary - Employee salary
